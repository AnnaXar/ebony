# Ebony Framework

An easy to use, module-based, multi-channel chatbot framework.

## Features

* Dialogue context management system
* Route-based rules, with middlewares
* Uses MongoDB for storing user information

## Getting Started 

For now, there is no detailed documentation for Ebony Framework. You can easily create a Facebook Messenger Bot with the [Messenger Bot Template](https://github.com/chrispanag/messenger-bot-template). If you have any questions and/or suggestions feel free to open an issue, or create a pull request.

### Channel Adapters

For now, only a [Messenger Platform](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform) adapter is publicly available. If you want to use the Ebony Framework for another channel, open an issue to discuss the development of a new adapter.
